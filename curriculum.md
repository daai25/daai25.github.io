## Prerequisites 

To participate in the summer school students need to master the **basics in Linear Algebra and Analysis** and have an **advanced level in Python programming**.

Preparatory material to reach a basic level in **Machine Learning** will be distributed beforehand. It is expected that the students prepare themselves with these documents for the summer school.

English Level B2 is compulsory.

## Program structure 
During the mornings, you will receive inputs and lectures, followed by structured exercises in a lab. In the afternoon you will work in teams on a challenge /task as project work.
The project work will last for the entire duration of teh summer school, at ZHAW as well as at GVSU.

Topical and touristic excursion complement the academic curriculum.
